00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.100 line:-4
and usage of modern point of sale

to allow you to get started quickly during the trial.

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.900 line:-4
Modern point of sale is a touch optimized,

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.100 line:-4
mobile point of sale solution from Microsoft

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.100 line:-4
with the flexibility to be used as a traditional point of sale,

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.800 line:-4
as well as for clientelling and inventory tasks. 

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.900 line:-4
This unique solution from Microsoft can be deployed in a way that suits you,

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.900 line:-4
whether that's on-premises, in the cloud, or hybrid,

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.400 line:-4
and we offer support for multiple platforms, 

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.400 line:-4
including Windows, iOS, Android, or browser-based cloud point-of-sale,

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.400 line:-4
ensuring a consistent experience regardless of the device you select. 

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.500 line:-4
The left navigation bar can be used for browsing of catalogs and categories,

14
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.400 line:-4
viewing the current transaction line count,

15
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.600 line:-4
and navigating between the transaction screen and welcome screen.

16
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.600 line:-4
The welcome screen provides a role-based starting point for the most common tasks,

17
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.200 line:-4
such as price checks, inventory lookups,

18
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.700 line:-4
drawer and shift operations, or viewing reports.

19
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.100 line:-4
Let's begin by searching for a customer. 

20
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.900 line:-4
We can search for customer at any point by using her name, email address, or loyalty card.

21
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.900 line:-4
Let's add Karen to the sale.

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900 line:-4
Karen is looking for a hand bag and some other accessories. 

23
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.400 line:-4
We can add these items to the transaction by scanning barcodes, 

24
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.400 line:-4
entering product numbers, browsing categories, or searching.

25
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.400 line:-4
When we set up the screen, we can also pin items to a specific button. 

26
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.400 line:-4
Once all items have been added to the transaction,

27
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.900 line:-4
we can tender the sale using any of the defined payment methods. 

28
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.700 line:-4
The most common payment methods can be assigned to buttons directly on the screen, 

29
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.700 line:-4
such as fast cash, foreign currency, customer account, or loyalty. 

30
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.700 line:-4
Karen will be paying with cash, the change is now tendered, and the transaction is completed.

31
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.300 line:-4
That was just a very brief introduction to allow you to get started with modern point of sale.
