00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100 line:-4
In this video we will look at some additional features within the point of sale

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.400 line:-4
which often be undertaken by a manager or supervisor. 

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.700 line:-4
These include things like end of day, 

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.700 line:-4
door in shift operations, cashier overrides, and reporting. 

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.100 line:-4
Alex, our store manager, is opening the store 

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.100 line:-4
and would like to get the point-of-sale terminal ready for the day.

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.600 line:-4
He opens a new shift and specifies the starting amount in the till. 

8
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.800 line:-4
Operations, such as float entry or tender removal, 

9
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.800 line:-4
can be used throughout the day to add and remove cash from the drawer.

10
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.800 line:-4
Safe and bank drops may also be performed as needed. 

11
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.800 line:-4
When the shift is over, dependent upon the configuration and privileges, 

12
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.100 line:-4
the operator can choose to close the shift immediately at the current terminal or, 

13
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.100 line:-4
in this case, we're going to blind close the shift and count it elsewhere. 

14
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600 line:-4
Now that we have the till safely in the manager's office, 

15
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.800 line:-4
we are going to perform a tender declaration and close the shift. 

16
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.300 line:-4
A tender declaration is simply the amount of cash

17
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.900 line:-4
or other tender that's been counted in the drawer.

18
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.100 line:-4
So, we will input the drawer contents here, 

19
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.100 line:-4
cash in a check, and save, and now I can go on to close the shift. 

20
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.600 line:-4
The register is now ready for the next operator to login and complete a transaction.

21
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.600 line:-4
Let's now login as a cashier, Ivo. 

22
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.100 line:-4
Our customer has two items they would like to purchase. 

23
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.100 line:-4
We add those two products to the transaction and are ready to complete the sale.

24
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.100 line:-4
At this point, the customer changes their mind and decides not to purchase the second item.

25
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.400 line:-4
In order to facilitate this, the cashier needs to void the item. 

26
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.100 line:-4
Ivo does not have permission to void line items,

27
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.100 line:-4
so a manager approval is required.

28
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.900 line:-4
Let's now look at some of the reporting functionality within the point of sale. 

29
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.800 line:-4
The reports we can see are controlled by the user access and 

30
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.300 line:-4
store permissions, and the data we can see is also controlled by this.

31
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.300 line:-4
Here we are logged in as a manager of the Houston store,

32
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.500 line:-4
so that's the information we will see.

33
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.300 line:-4
Let's look at sales by register. 

34
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.300 line:-4
We can specify a date range and the year.

35
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.300 line:-4
In this case, we are looking at a one-year period.

36
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.800 line:-4
We can see the results and values graphically.

37
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.800 line:-4
We can now see the numbers of transactions, the sales amounts,

38
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.300 line:-4
and the average sales amount across the registers in the Houston store.

39
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.300 line:-4
Let's take a look at another example.

40
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.500 line:-4
We would like to know what the top 10 products are,

41
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.100 line:-4
so again, we set the date range,

42
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.800 line:-4
and we can now see the sales amount and the quantity

43
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.800 line:-4
for each of the top-selling products.

44
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.833 line:-4
Thank you for watching and please continue to the trial.
